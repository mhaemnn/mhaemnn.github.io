Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am an Informatics Engineering student at [uwg][def1], with a focus on technology exploration. With a strong educational foundation, I deepened my web development skills.

Participation in web developer training at [`Digitalent`][def2] provides practical insight and increases technical proficiency.

As part of the [`Independent Campus`][def3] Program at [Hacktiv8][def4], I studied information security, completing my understanding of technology. Involvement in [`dicoding`][def5] & [`Digitalent`][def2] online training programs aims to update software development knowledge and skills.
