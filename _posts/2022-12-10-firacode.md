<i>Fira Code: is a monospaced font with programming ligatures.</i>
</blockquote>

But what are font ligatures? Developers use a lot of sequencial symbols in programming, for example: => , <= and !==. The font ligatures will basically transform visuallly this multiple characteres into just one, they will have a different look, maybe more beautiful than the normal look of the separated symbols.
